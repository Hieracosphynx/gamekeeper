calculations, tracking game state, and providing specialized tools while preserving the physical,
social nature of board gaming.

## Core Concept

- **Digital assistants** for physical board games
- **Calculation helpers** and state trackers
- **Role-based interfaces** (Banker, Player, Spectator views)
- **Static web app** requiring no backend infrastructure

### What It's NOT

- Full digital recreation of board games
- Replacement for physical components
- Real-time multiplayer gaming platform
- Complex game engine or simulation

## Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### Core Framework

- **Astro** - Static site generator with island architecture
- **React** - Primary component library for interactive elements
- **TypeScript** - Type safety across the platform

#### Multi-Framework Support

- **Vue.js** - Alternative for contributors preferring Vue
- **Svelte** - Lightweight option for performance-critical components
- **Vanilla JS** - Simple plugins requiring minimal overhead

#### Styling & UI
